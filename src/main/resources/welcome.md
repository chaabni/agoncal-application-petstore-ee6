# Welcome to Vaadinized JEE6 Petshop example

This is an example app that shows how one can replace JSF interface with an UI
built with [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com).

Note, that the app should not be used as reference app as such. It contains 
critical missing features from the original project like password hashing. Also
The controllers in "web" package are originally built for JSF and thus are not 
that optimal for Vaadin UI.

In addition to Vaadin the example contains following Vaadin add-ons:

 * Vaadin CDI - to connect to backend services
 * Maddon - to remove some boilerplate code from UI code
